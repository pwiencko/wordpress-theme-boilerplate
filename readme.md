# Wordpress Theme Boilerplate
This **Wordpress Theme Boilerpate** was made for me by myself. But use it if you only need. :) 
It's not free of bugs, but it's my core way to create Wordpress theme and I do not want to repeat myself a lot of times.
## Implemented
 - versioning of included scripts (avoiding cache for recently visited users);
 - simple template-parts files, to further development;
 - whole CSS is in **/assets/css** instead of main style.css file, where I placed only Wordpress theme informations - it's easier to maintain.

Like I told in the beginning - I made it for myself, but  I will be happy if you will use it. Every possible changes are pleased to tell. :)
